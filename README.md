# Ping Pong Score Keeper

A score keeper to help you get your ping pong on. :)

Description:

I am currently doing a web development bootcamp on Udemy, this project is part of a CodeAlong that I am doing in my bootcamp. The instructions were that I was to recreate an app that will track the scores of a ping pong game. My instructor/teacher showed me what the final app would look like and how it would work.

How To Use App:

There are two "0" scores underneath the main image on the page, these show each players score - player 1 on the left and player 2 on the right. Underneath the player scores is an option called "playing until", this option will allow you to choose a score limit. Lastly there are three buttons at the bottom of the page. The buttons labelled "Player 1+" and "Player 2+" will increase the scores of the players but 1. The "Reset" button will reset the scores and unlock the buttons when the scorekeeper wishes to do so. When the score limit has been reached the winners score will be displayed in green and the losers in red the "player 1+" and "Player 2+" buttons will be locked and will only be unlocked when the game has been reset.
